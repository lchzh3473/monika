It's intended to only distract you every once in a while.\n\nQ: Can the lines be customized?\nA: Yup, just change them in the MonikaLines.json file within the directory for this wallpaper.\n\nQ: Why doesn't the outer space background look identical to how it looks in the game?\nA: Couldn't figure out how to replicate it. If someone can share a method for replicating the effect in PIXI.js, I will add.\n\nQ: How come the images look kind of low-res?\nA: Up-scaled them from the originals. If someone can provide a higher quality version for 1080p, I will (probably) fix.\n\nQ: How do I set up my name?\nA: It should show you at the start. Just find the directory and edit the Name.txt.\n\nQ: Can you combine this will Live2D?\nA: Yup, but I'm not going to waste time on making the model. If someone can provide a fully functional Live2D Monika, then I'll add it (if I'm not feeling lazy).",
